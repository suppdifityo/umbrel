## Benefits of Igo Primo
 
Igo Primo is not just a navigation software, but also a multifunctional system that offers many benefits for its users. Here are some of them:

- Offline maps: You don't need an internet connection to use Igo Primo, as it stores the maps on your device's SD card. This means you can save data and battery, and navigate even in areas with poor signal.
- Voice guidance: You can listen to clear and accurate voice instructions in 28 languages, and even hear the street names with the TTS function (Text to Speech). This helps you keep your eyes on the road and avoid distractions.
- Speed limit warnings: You can see the current speed limit on the screen, and get alerted when you exceed it. This helps you avoid fines and drive safely.
- Lane assistant: You can see the real display of road signs and the best lane to take before turning. This helps you avoid confusion and missed exits.
- Tunnel view: You can see the tunnel interior view when you enter a tunnel, to avoid distracting changes in brightness and map details.
- Traffic information: You can get real-time traffic information via TMC (Traffic Message Channel), which uses radio signals to provide you with important updates on traffic jams, accidents, or road closures. You can then adjust your route accordingly.
- Route settings: You can choose your preferred route type, such as fastest, shortest, or most economical. You can also set your avoidances, such as toll roads, ferries, or unpaved roads. You can even customize your route for your vehicle dimensions, if you have a truck or a caravan.
- Map settings: You can choose your preferred map view, such as 2D or 3D. You can also set your orientation, such as north up or track up. You can also adjust your zoom level, landmarks, POIs (Points of Interest), and other options.
- Other features: You can also enjoy other features of Igo Primo, such as music/video player, E-book reader, radio, and some Windows functionality. You can also update your maps and software easily with the Toolbox application.
